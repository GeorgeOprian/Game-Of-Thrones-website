# Game-Of-Thrones-website

I've build this website as a final project of the Web course in college.

It's build only using HTML, CSS and Javascript.
The website interacts with a Node JS server, which is used sign up and log in a user.
It also has a comments sections, were users can post and delete comments.
It has some other functionalities that don't really fit in the website context, but I had to implement them to meet the requirements of the course.
