                    <span class = "important_in_p">Jon Snow</span> , born Aegon Targaryen, is the son of Lyanna Stark and Rhaegar Targaryen, the late Prince of Dragonstone. From infancy, Jon is presented as the bastard son of Lord Eddard Stark, Lyanna's brother, and raised alongside his lawful children at Winterfell, the seat of House Stark.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In order to escape his bastard status, Jon joins the Night's Watch and is eventually chosen as Lord Commander. As Lord Commander, Jon makes several decisions, such as allowing the wildlings to settle south of the Wall in order not to be killed by wights. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    When the war for Westeros begins, Jon negotiates with Daenerys Targaryen, Rhaegar's sister, to secure her support against the White Walkers, her dragons and abundance of obsidian on her military base of Dragonstone providing a distinct advantage in the Great War.Jon pledges himself and his army to Daenerys, whom he falls in love with, subsequently abdicating and being named Warden of the North.
                </p>
                <p>
                    His lineage is revealed to him by Samwell Tarly, he fights in the Battle of Winterfell, during which the Night King is defeated and the return of the Long Night is prevented. Afterwards, Jon aids Daenerys in her resumed campaign to take the Iron Throne and participates in the Battle of King's Landing. However, when Daenerys lays waste to a surrendered King's Landing, Jon attempts, but fails, to prevent his men from sacking the city. Unable to dissuade Daenerys from this path, a conflicted Jon assassinates her to prevent further carnage

                        I spent my life in foreign lands. So many men have tried to kill me, I don't remember all their names. I have been sold like a broodmare. I've been chained and betrayed, raped and defiled. Do you know what kept me standing through all those years in exile? Faith. Not in any gods. Not in myths and legends. In myself. In Daenerys Targaryen. The world hadn't seen a dragon in centuries until my children were born. The Dothraki hadn't crossed the sea. Any sea. They did for me. I was born to rule the Seven Kingdoms, and I will
